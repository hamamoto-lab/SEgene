and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2025-04-05

### Added
- **New component: SEgene_RegionAnalyzer**:
  - Added a new analytical tool for evaluating super-enhancer activity in genomic regions of interest
  - Integrated with public databases (currently SEdb 2.0)
  - Performs enrichment analysis of tissue-specific super-enhancer associations
  - Supports both SEgene output TSV files and standard BED format inputs
  - Generates comprehensive TSV reports and visual HTML outputs
- **Documentation**:
  - Added detailed documentation for SEgene_RegionAnalyzer
  - Updated main README to include the new component in the project structure

### Changed
- Reorganized the project structure to include SEgene_RegionAnalyzer as an optional component
- Updated the workflow description to reflect the extended analytical capabilities

## [1.4.0] - 2025-03-19

### Added
- **Enhanced network visualization capabilities**:
  - Added detailed graph drawing methods (`draw_network_detailed`, `draw_subnetwork_detailed`, `draw_two_layer_subnetwork_detailed`)
  - Added support for multiple output formats (SVG, PNG, EPS, PDF) across all visualization functions
  - Added customization options for node styling, edge styling, and subgraph boundaries
- **Improved data export functionality**:
  - Added ability to save graph data alongside visualizations
  - Added logging capabilities for reproducibility
  - Added support for exporting data in various formats (CSV, TSV, JSON)
- **Enhanced visualization parameters**:
  - Added resolution (DPI) control for raster format outputs
  - Added figure size and styling customization options
  - Added custom title support for all network visualization methods (`draw_network`, `draw_subnetwork`, `draw_two_layer_subnetwork`)

### Changed
- Updated existing visualization methods to support expanded format options
- Extended graph rendering interfaces with additional customization parameters
- Improved file naming and organization for saved outputs

### Notes
- These visualization enhancements are designed to maintain compatibility with existing network analysis functions

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-15

### Added
- **Enhanced visualization options** for ROSE summary plots:
  - Added customizable parameters for DPI, figure size, and output format
  - Improved figure saving capabilities with format selection

### Fixed
- Fixed threshold comparison in `p2gl_path_to_filter_df` function to correct filtering behavior

### Notes
- Added pronunciation guide for SEgene ("S-E-gene") in documentation

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-11

### Added
- **New core analysis capabilities** for SE rank distribution:
  - Added functionality to search for gene-linked super-enhancers across multiple samples
  - Implemented super-enhancer ranking analysis within datasets 
  - Developed statistical tools for percentile calculation and distribution analysis
  - Created visualization methods for SE rank distributions across samples
- **New tutorial notebooks** to demonstrate the new analysis features:
  - `tutorial_book_SE_rank_disribution.ipynb` (English)
  - `tutorial_book_SE_rank_disribution_ja.ipynb` (Japanese)
  - These notebooks guide users through analyzing the ranking status (position and percentile) of super-enhancers corresponding to specific genes

### Notes
- Documentation in README files has been updated to include information about the new notebooks

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-07

### Added
- **New CLI tools (`cli_tools/`)** for streamlined featureCounts processing, CPM calculation, and SEâ€“gene correlation analysis
  - Scripts such as `generate_gtf.py`, `generate_file_list.sh`, `run_featurecounts_array.sh`, etc.
  - `correlation_analysis.py` computes Pearson correlation between SE (CPM) and genes (TPM)
- **Documentation updates**:
  - Added **English (`README.md`)** and **Japanese (`README_ja.md`)** documentation under `cli_tools/`
  - Updated the main repository documentation (`README.md`) and `SE_to_gene_links/` docs to explain how to integrate the new CLI tools

### Changed
- Refined repository structure by separating stand-alone CLI scripts into `cli_tools/`, independent of `SEgene_package`

### Notes
- The newly added documents provide usage instructions and workflow details in both English and Japanese  
- Enables advanced or extended analyses on top of the existing `SE_to_gene_links` functionalities

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Initial release of SEgene, a comprehensive platform for identifying and analyzing Super-Enhancer-to-gene links through statistical approaches
  - `peak_to_gene_links`:
    - Retrieves correlation information between gene expression and enhancer peaks
    - Data analysis and visualization support
  - `SE_to_gene_links`:
    - Evaluates and analyzes super-enhancer to gene links using correlation data
    - Graph theory-based data visualization
    - Interactive analysis with Jupyter Notebook
- Detailed installation instructions and documentation in the GitHub repository
